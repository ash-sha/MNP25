Points for Improvement:

- [ ]  Copy all beneficiary with Aadhar in database- make sure all documents are usable for ready next year. - qty 0 are not selected
- [ ]  Add parent category name while inputing
- [ ]  figure out Project while inputing(refer last year)
- [ ]  separate sewing machine with motor
- [ ]  public and. instn  - update article - cost not happening
- Inventory - add ordered qty seperately for beneficiary types?
